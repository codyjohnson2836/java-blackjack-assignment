# java-blackjack-assignment
A Blackjack program, written in Java, to be played through command line. Features implemented within the program include common blackjack operations, such as hitting, standing, doubling down, taking insurance, and surrendering. Betting using in-game chips is also offered. The program functions using basic command-line I/O; the player can type numbers and press enter to select desired options or input betting amounts.

Building/running instructions: This program was designed using JDK version 16.0.1. In order to compile and run this program, the five included .java files (Blackjack.java, Card.java, Deck.java, Game.java, Hand.java) must be placed within the same folder, and the file "Blackjack.java" must be compiled with JDK version 16.0.1 installed using the following command:

    javac Blackjack.java

After this is complete, the program can be run using the following command:

    java Blackjack

Thank you for trying my program! I hope you enjoy it. Included in the repository are two text documents: "plan.txt" and "possible future features.txt". The first file outlines the rough plans I drew up and outlined while making the program, and only partially represents the final product. The second file outlines possible updates that would improve the quality of the program were they to be implemented. While I am currently satisfied with how the program turned out, there is always room for improvement.
